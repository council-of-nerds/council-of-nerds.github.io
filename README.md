# AQUACAST
  Aquacast is a minimalistic app that displays the water quality of your surrounding water bodies.
  It features a Map, a Contribute button, a functioning Facts page and a list of endangered animals in your locality. [Only India for now: As of 10/10/23]

## Sources
   Sources were scarce during the preperation of this project. We had to do a bit of digging around to find some useable solid data.
  + National Water Monitoring Programme or **NWMP** ---> This data was used for the Indian water bodies. (This data was outdated and limited)
  + United States Geological Survey or **USGS** ---> This data was used for the US water bodies. (This data was updated in realtime, but we found it pretty late into the project. So all we could do was link the data to their respective links)

## What could be added?
  Aquacast could be a great informatory application that could possibly save a ton of lives.
